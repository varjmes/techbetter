                <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
                <p>JSConf EU is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
                <h2 id="anti-harassment">Anti-harassment</h2>
                <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion</li>
                    <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
                    <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
                    <li>Harassing photography or reacording</li>
                    <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
                    <li>Invasion of personal space</li>
                    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                    <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
                <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                <p><strong>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants.</strong> This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
                <p>Event organisers may take action to address anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>
                <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
                <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.</p>
                <h2 id="inclusive-language">Inclusive language</h2>
                <p>In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we strongly believe it’s important to pay attention to harmful language patterns.</p>
                <h3 id="ableism">Ableism</h3>
                <p>Words like “crazy”, “dumb”, “insane” or “lame” are examples of <strong>ableist language</strong>, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.</p>
                <p>To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read <a href="http://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html">this guide</a>.</p>
                <h3 id="sexism">Sexism</h3>
                <p>Using gendered terms like <em>“dude”</em> or <em>“guys”</em> to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.</p>
